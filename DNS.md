DNS (Domain Name System) is like the **phonebook of the internet**. It translates **human-readable domain names** (like `google.com`) into **IP addresses** (like `142.250.190.14`) so computers can understand and connect to websites.

>A records are standard DNS records while Alias records are custom DNS records

> ==A "DNS alias" is essentially a nickname or alternative name for a domain, pointing to another existing domain name (like a "www" subdomain), while a "DNS name" refers to the primary, canonical name of a domain that directly resolves to an IP address==;Â in simpler terms, an alias is a way to access a domain using a different name, while the DNS name is the actual, recognized address on the internet.


custom name => real name => ip address

**DNS name**: domain name (google.com)
**DNS alias**: nick name for the domain
